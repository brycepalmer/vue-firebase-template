# Vue 3 Template

## About this project

I just wanted to create my own opinionated Vue project template. So i started from scratch, all the history is on this very same repo, mistakes and all.

Works best with Visual Studio Code, it has some rules set up on the same project. Eventually i will add some recommended plugins.

## Setup

### `.env`

Go to your [Firebase Project](https://console.firebase.google.com) and get your config file, then create a `.env` file with the following structure:

```bash
# Firebase Config
VITE_API_KEY=""
VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
VITE_PROJECT_ID=""
VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""
VITE_APP_ID=""
```

### `.firebaserc`

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "your-project-name"
  }
}
```

### Development

```sh
# To run the local environment
yarn dev
```

### Build

```sh
# Build your project for production
yarn build
```

Then just upload your `dist/` folder to your cloud provider.

## Deployment

This app can be deployed at any server, but this is already preconfigured to deploy with firebase.

```sh
# Add firebase tools as a global package
yarn add global firebase-tools

# Login into firebase
firebase login

# After login just deploy
firebase deploy
```

## Nice Things to Have

## Features

### File Based Router

Provided by the `vite-plugin-pages` package.

The `.vue` files under the `src/pages` are mapped as a route.

### Eslint Setup

We use the airbnb base guides for Js and TS.
For Vue files we use the vue-essential guide.

VueJS has an issue declared where it won't check for the usage of the variables defined in the script when using the setup syntax. As a workaround the check of unused variables has been disabled for Vue files inside the `/src` folder.

### Component Auto Import

Powered by `unplugin-vue-components`

Just use your components in your templates and they will be auto imported.

This plugin has been already setup with the [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/) framework. So the components will be auto registered in the components.d.ts file and tree shaken automatically.

For documentation please visit: [NaiveUI Docs](https://www.naiveui.com/en-US/os-theme/docs/usage-sfc)

### Api Auto Import

Supports the following API's. For more information on the available auto imports refer click [here](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import/blob/main/src/presets).

- [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/global-api.html)
- [Vue-Router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/api/)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev/core-concepts/)
- [@vueuse](https://vueuse.org/functions.html)
- [@vueuse/head](https://github.com/vueuse/head#api)

### Route aliasing

Provided by: `vite-aliases` npm package.

All folders under the `src` folder will be mapped as alias. The current structure of the folders will create the following aliases:

```javascript
{
  @: './src',
  @assets: './src/assets',
  @components: './src/components',
  @layouts: './src/layouts',
  @pages: './src/pages',
  @store: './src/store'
}
```

As the project grows, more folders will be added and the tsconfig.json file will be updated with the new aliases.

### Layouts

This template supports layouts via [`vite-plugin-vue-templates`](https://github.com/JohnCampionJr/vite-plugin-vue-layouts)

If not defined, the route will use the `default.vue` layout.

To define a template for the route, you need to provide the template in the `<route>` block. In this case, the component will look for `templates/custom.vue` for it's layout. You can also name the route for named links.

```html
<route lang="yaml">
meta:
  name: 'named-route'
  layout: custom
</route>
```

### State management

Achieved using [`pinia`](https://pinia.esm.dev/)

The `src/store/demo.ts` file has a fully working demo store. And the `App.vue` file uses this store.

### Persisted state

For persisted state, you need to declare the value of the persisted state in your store. Refer to the `src/store/demo.ts` file for a working example.
